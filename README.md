This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview intermittently freezes, resulting in a black screen. The issue is not consistently reproducible and lacks a clear error message in the console logs.  A potential solution is provided, involving checking for and handling permission issues more robustly, along with error handling for camera availability and initialization.  Contributions and further debugging are welcome.
